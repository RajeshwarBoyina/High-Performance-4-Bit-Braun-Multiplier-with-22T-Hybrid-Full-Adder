## Abstract

  ***Low power and high speed circuits have become important requirements in high performance VLSI design in the last few years. An Arithmetic Logic Unit basically consists of an Adder and a Multiplier. The basic component of any ALU is an adder and the operation performed by it is called as addition. And this adder is used as a building block to design a multiplier. Hence, multiplication becomes a fundamental unit of any DSP application like FFT, etc. As a result, new approaches to arithmetic circuit design are needed to achieve desirable output in terms of area, power and delay.***
  
  ***The main objective is to design a High Performance Adder and Multiplier which will be working upto 2 GHz clock frequency. The proposed Hybrid Full Adder is designed  using Pass Transistors, Transmission gates and Conventional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor. For multiplication operation, Braun multiplier architecture has been implemented using the above mentioned adder. And the average propagation delay and power dissipated by both the circuits is also calculated.***

## Reference Circuit Details

### Braun Multiplier
  * The Braun multiplier has one ripple carry adder stage and '(n-1)' carry save adders for producing partial products. 
  * Carry Save Adder:
    - The carry save adder is a digital adder that is used to add three or more 'n' bit binary numbers together. It works in the same way as a Full adder.
  * Ripple Carry Adder:
    - The arithmetic sum of binary numbers is generated by a ripple carry adder, which is a digital circuit. It can be built using Full adders in a cascade, with              the carry outputs of each Full adder linked to the carry input of the next Full adder.
  * AND gates and Full adders make up the architecture of a Braun multiplier. Each partial product can be combined with the sum of partial products generated previously     by a row of adders.The carry out will be moved one bit to the left or right, and then it will be dded to the first adder's sum and the newly formed partial product.
  * The Carry Save Adder will be used to shift the data, and the Ripple Carry Adder will be used for the final stage of the output. As a result, the Braun multiplier         will be applied.

### 22T Hybrid Full Adder
  * The proposed FA is divided into four major modules:
    - two for carry generation 
    - two for sum genration.
  * Carry Generation:
    - A novel AND-OR module based on TG and CPL logic is implemented as part of the proposed carry generation part.
