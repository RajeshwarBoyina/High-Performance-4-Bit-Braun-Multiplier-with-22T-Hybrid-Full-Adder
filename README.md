## Abstract

Low power and high speed circuits have become important requirements in high performance VLSI design in the last few years. An Arithmetic Logic Unit basically consists of an adder and a multiplier. The basic component of any ALU is an adder and the operation performed by it is called as addition. And this adder is used as a building block to design a multiplier. Hence, multiplication becomes a fundamental unit of any DSP application like FFT, etc. As a result, new approaches to arithmetic circuit design are needed to achieve desirable output in terms of area, power and delay.
